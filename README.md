#### Emacs Go! Go! Go!

I don't know, I created a new emacs repo **again**.

It seems that I cannot be satisfied with my emacs forever (*sad-face*)

##### Usage

```shell
git clone https://github.com/xuuexu/Emacs-Go-Go-Go.git ~/.emacs.d
cd ~/.emacs.d
cask install
```

##### Any different from previous one?

1. I would more focus on the keybindings(`evil`? maybe, `hydra`? why not? idk)
2. ?????
